# CSAPP Course

This is my personal repo for resource when learning CS\:APP3e like labs, slides, recitations, etc. 

Official CSAPP site: [CS:APP3e, Bryant and O'Hallaron (cmu.edu)](http://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/3e/students.html)

Video: [2015 CMU 15-213 CSAPP 深入理解计算机系统 课程视频_哔哩哔哩_bilibili](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1iW411d7hd)

The slides are taken from CMU website ([15-213/15-513/14-513 Introduction to Computer Systems: Resources (cmu.edu)](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~213/resources.html)) at seminar of fall 2015, spring 2023 and summer 2023(the last lecture slide).

The 4 and 6 labs are not introduced and assigned in the video course and are book-exclusive. Maybe one day I will finish them ~~(or never)~~.

The solution and README are in the Labs/No_XLab folder. The README within each solved lab folder records my thinking when solving and some resources to reference.
