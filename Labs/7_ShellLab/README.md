# Solving Shell Lab

*Hints* of Assignment PDF is essential to read and extremely useful. Just as first hint said “Read every word of Chapter 8 (ECF) in your textbook.”

After reading it, the lab will be much easier. With more hint in pdf, it’s not hard but need carefulness to finish it. I think it much more easier than cache lab.
